# 3D-Graphics-Engine
This is a 3-D graphics engine made for my stupid no good graphics practical.

#BUILDING PROCEDURE
You need to get the graphics.h file from Turbo c++
Other than that ,the files should build i any decent IDE
(I personally used the CodeBlocks IDE for this)



Right now I'm in the process of building out the core modules for this engine
I plan on adding at the very least these features:

#PROPOSED FEATURE LIST
-drawing 2d scalar shapes which include
LINES
ELLIPSES
CIRCLES
ARCS
POLYGONS
-Drawing curves
HERMIT CURVE
BEZIER CURVE


-Colouring
SCANLINE
SEEDFILL

--2D AND 3D TRANSFORMATIONS
translation
rotation 
scaling

#Pull Requests to make the engine better aremost welcome , just send them over and I'll look them
over and push them in if they're good.

# 3D-Graphics-Engine
This is a 3-D graphics engine made for my stupid no good graphics practical.

#BUILDING PROCEDURE
You need to get the graphics.h file from Turbo c++
Other than that ,the files should build in any decent IDE
(I personally used the CodeBlocks IDE for this)



Right now I'm in the process of building out the core modules for this engine
I plan on adding at the very least these features:

#PROPOSED FEATURE LIST
##drawing 2d scalar shapes which include
##Lines
##Ellipses
##Circles
##Arcs
##Polygons
##Drawing curves
##Hermit Curve
##Bezier Curve



#Colouring
##Scanfill
##SeedFill

#2D AND 3D TRANSFORMATIONS
##translation
##rotation 
##scaling

#Pull Requests to make the engine better aremost welcome
I'll look the proposed changes over and push them in if they're good.
